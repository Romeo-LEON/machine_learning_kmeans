# My first Machine Learning instance ðŸ’»
I realised this project in order to apply the skills I developped during the "data science with python" skill track I completed on DataCamp.

This is a "dummy" project is the extent that it could be considered as a pure technical demonstration of what I'm able to do using Python.

The main components of this project are :

- The programming language Python 3
- Scikit Learn (K-Means algorithm)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Pandas
- Numpy

Have fun discovering this project !ðŸ˜„
